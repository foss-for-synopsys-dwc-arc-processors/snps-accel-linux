config SNPS_ARCSYNC
	tristate "Synopsys ARCsync driver"
	help
	  This option enables the driver developed for Syncopsys ARCSync
	  module. ARCSync is used for synchronization and control of
	  multiple ARC processor assembled in a heterogeneous sub-system.
	  The driver controls ARCSync and provides a set of functions to
	  send commands to ARC processors, issue interrupts and register
	  handler ARCsync interrupt. The Synopsys VPX/NPX remoteproc and
	  accelerator drivers depend on this module.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snps_arcsync.

config SNPS_ACCEL_APP
	tristate "Synopsys NPX/VPX application helper driver"
	select SNPS_ARCSYNC
	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	help
	  Enables Synopsys VPX/NPX support to provide interface and API
	  for user-space driver in MetawareMX NN Runtime.

	  The user-space interface is described in
	  include/uapi/misc/snps_npu.h

	  If "M" is selected, the module will be called snps_accel.
