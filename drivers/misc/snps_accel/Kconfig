	help
	  This option enables the driver developed for Syncopsys ARCSync
	  module. ARCSync is used for synchronization and control of
	  multiple ARC processor assembled in a heterogenous sub-system.
	  The driver controlls ARCSync and provides a set of functions to
	  send commands to ARC processoes, issue interrups and register
	  handler ARCsync interrupt. The Synopsys VPX/NPX remoteproc and
	  accelerator drivers depend on this module.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snps_arcsync.
